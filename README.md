# Project Description

Initially I wanted to create a dataset of how people described their pain to their doctors, but this information is very hard to come by. Instead I stumbled upon a lot of different articles and self helps books that would educate you on how to talk to your doctor, which is an interesting concept - why would you have to learn to manipulate the person in front of you at a consultation. 
Therefore, I wanted to create a dataset of how people actually described it versus how people were advised to describe it. 

## Assignment 1: Creation of the dataset 
Dataset created using PRAW API and Python.

## Assignment 2: Datasheet 
The datasheet for the dataset containing technical information about the collection, the background of the people involved and ethical discussions addressing the use and limitations of the data. 

## Assignment 3: CPPN with Pytorch 
Notebook containing a CPPN. Using different activation function and optimizers to interrogate the impact on the output of a Compositional pattern-producing network.
